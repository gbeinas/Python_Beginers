# Examples with Data Type : Tuples

# A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists.
# The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists
# and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.

# Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated values.
# Optionally you can put these comma-separated values between parentheses also.
#
# For example âˆ’

# tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000);
# tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 );
# tup3 = "a", "b", "c", "d";
